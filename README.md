33c3-Phonebook
==============

This app is a work in progress, that takes the [eventphone phonebook](https://www.eventphone.de/guru2/phonebook) as a JSON file as an input and makes it available on your iPhone.

When you have this year's SIM card installed and are connected to the GSM network you're even able to call directly from the app.
